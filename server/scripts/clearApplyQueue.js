// One-off utility: wipes ONLY the "apply" BullMQ queue in Redis.
//
// Why this exists: BullMQ queues are Redis-backed and durable — a job's
// payload is fixed at the moment it's added and never changes, no matter
// how many times the server/worker process is restarted afterwards.
// Restarting Node does NOT clear anything in Redis. So any apply jobs
// that were queued while testing BEFORE the ownerUserId fix landed in
// routes/applyRoutes.js are still sitting in Redis with their old
// payload (`{ jobId }`, no ownerUserId), and BullMQ keeps retrying them
// (up to their `attempts: 3` with backoff) every time a worker becomes
// available — which is exactly why a freshly-restarted worker can still
// report "job 1/2/3 has no ownerUserId": those are leftover pre-fix
// jobs, not newly-queued ones, even though they surface as "fresh"
// activity from the worker's point of view.
//
// This script only touches the "apply" queue — ingest/match/analytics/
// scrape are untouched. It does NOT change any application code path;
// it just clears stale queue state so you can re-test cleanly.
//
// Usage (from the server/ directory, with your real .env in place):
//   node scripts/clearApplyQueue.js
