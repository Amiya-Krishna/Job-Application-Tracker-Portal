// shared — and write one match_scores row per job with no notion of
// whose profile it came from. Now that user_profile is per-user
// (user_profile.user_id, see schema.prisma) and match_scores is unique
// per (job_id, profile_id, method), this scores:
//   - just the submitting user's profile, when the job came from that
//     user's manual/extension/gmail bridge (ownerUserId is set), or
//   - every user's profile, when the job has no single owner (scrape/
//     discovery results are shared catalog data every user should see
//     matched against their own resume).

  // a string — JSON.stringify(result.explanation)) as a plain
  // `text`-typed parameter unless told otherwise in the SQL, and
  // Postgres won't implicitly convert text -> jsonb — hence "column
  // explanation is of type jsonb but expression is of type text".
  // Casting both occurrences (VALUES and the UPDATE's SET) to `::jsonb`
  // fixes it and keeps explanation's real shape ({matched_skills,
  // missing_skills, similarity, skill_boost} — see matchingService.js)
  // stored as structured JSON, not a double-encoded string.
