# TrackTrail Browser Extension

Manage your whole job search from the extension popup — no need to open the
dashboard site. Adds a floating **"+ Save to TrackTrail"** button on
LinkedIn and Indeed job postings, and the popup itself is now a mini
dashboard: browse, search, filter, add, change status, and delete jobs.

## Install (unpacked, for now — not published to the Chrome Web Store)

1. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome (or `edge://extensions` in Edge).
2. Turn on **Developer mode** (top-right toggle).
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select this `browser-extension` folder.
4. The TrackTrail icon should appear in your toolbar. Pin it for easy access.

## First-time setup

1. Click the TrackTrail icon in your toolbar.
2. Log in with the same email/password you use on the TrackTrail website.
   The extension talks to whatever backend URL is set as `DEFAULT_API_BASE_URL`
   in `config.js` — there's no in-popup settings UI for changing it; if you
   redeploy the backend elsewhere, edit that constant directly (see
   "API settings — removed", below).

## What's in the popup now

- **Jobs tab** — search by company/role, filter by status chip
  (Applied / Interviewing / Offer / Rejected), change a job's status
  inline from a dropdown, delete a job, open the original posting link.
- **Add tab** — add a job manually (company, role, status, link, notes)
  without needing to be on LinkedIn/Indeed.
- **Stats tab** — quick counts of total jobs and jobs per status.
- **Settings (gear icon)** — change the backend API URL without editing
  code.

## Using the on-page save button

1. Browse to any job posting on LinkedIn (`linkedin.com/jobs/...`) or
   Indeed (`indeed.com/...`).
2. A dark "+ Save to TrackTrail" button appears in the bottom-right corner.
3. Click it. The job's company and role are auto-detected from the page
   and saved with status "Applied". Edit the status or delete it later
   from the popup's Jobs tab.

## How detection works (and its limits)

The content script reads the job title and company name from the page
using a few known CSS selectors, with a fallback to parsing the page's
`<title>` tag if those selectors don't match. LinkedIn and Indeed change
their page markup periodically, so if the button stops picking up the
right company/role, the selectors in `content.js` likely need a quick
update — check `detectLinkedIn()` / `detectIndeed()`.

## Backend routes this extension uses (confirmed against `server/routes/jobRoutes.js`)

- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `GET /api/jobs` — list, scoped to the logged-in user
- `POST /api/jobs` — used for both on-page save and the manual Add tab
- `PUT /api/jobs/:id` — used by the status dropdown in the Jobs tab
- `DELETE /api/jobs/:id` — used by the delete button

`TrackedJob` fields (from `prisma/schema.prisma`): `company`, `role`,
`status`, `applicationDate`, `interviewDate`, `notes`. There's no `link`/URL
field on this model, so the popup doesn't send or display one.

The backend also has a separate, bigger "intelligent apply engine" (Job
Discovery, TF-IDF matching, apply queue, analytics, profile) under
`/api/engine/jobs`, `/api/applications`, `/api/analytics`, `/api/profile` —
the popup's Jobs/Add/Stats tabs above don't touch it, but the full dashboard
(next section) does.

## Full dashboard (new)

The popup now has an **"Open full dashboard ↗"** button (visible once
logged in) that opens `dashboard.html` in a new tab. This is where the
bigger "intelligent apply engine" lives, since a 360px popup isn't enough
room for it:

- **Matched Jobs** — scraped jobs from `/api/engine/jobs`, filterable by
  status and minimum match score, with a "Queue apply" button that calls
  `POST /api/applications/:jobId`.
- **Applications** — `/api/applications`, filterable by status, with
  "Mark as applied" and outcome buttons (Interview / Offer / Rejected).
- **Analytics** — summary + conversion rates from `/api/analytics`, and
  a scraped → matched → applied → interview → offer funnel from
  `/api/analytics/funnel`.
- **Profile** — view/edit the resume/skills profile used for matching,
  via `/api/profile`.

These engine routes require the same `token` auth header as everything else
in this extension — `/api/engine/jobs`, `/api/applications`, `/api/analytics`,
`/api/profile`, `/api/companies`, and `/api/sources` are all mounted with
`auth` at the `app.use(...)` level in `server.js`, and the dashboard's
`apiAuth()` helper in `dashboard.js` already attaches the stored token to
every one of these calls.

`jobs.id`, `applications.id`, and similar Postgres `BigInt` columns are
already handled: `server/lib/prisma.js` and `server.js` both add a
`BigInt.prototype.toJSON` override before any route runs, so `res.json()`
serializes them without throwing.

If you want a shareable install link instead of "load unpacked": zip this
folder's contents (not the folder itself) and submit it through the
[Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole)
(one-time $5 developer fee). Not required for a portfolio/demo.

## Sign up (new)

The login screen now has a "Don't have an account? Sign up" link that
switches to a registration form (name, email, password). It calls
`POST /api/auth/register`, then automatically logs in with the same
credentials so there's no extra step.

## Gmail integration (new)

The dashboard's **Email** tab mirrors the Gmail integration already on the
website (`routes/gmailRoutes.js`):

- **Connect Gmail** — calls `GET /api/gmail/auth-url` and opens the Google
  consent screen in a new tab. The server's OAuth callback redirects to
  your website's `/integrations` page (not back to the extension) — after
  finishing consent, come back to this tab and click "Refresh status".
- **Scan inbox** — calls `GET /api/gmail/scan` (last 30 days,
  interview/application/offer keywords) and lists matching emails. Each
  one has a company field + "Save as job" button that calls
  `POST /api/gmail/import` to add it to your tracker.
- **Disconnect** — calls `POST /api/gmail/disconnect`.

These routes require the same auth token as the Jobs tab, so you need to
be logged in via the popup first. Gmail also needs `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`,
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` set in `server/.env` —
see `config/google.js`.

## API settings — removed

The earlier "API settings" panel (editable backend URL) has been removed.
The extension now always uses `DEFAULT_API_BASE_URL` from `config.js`. If
you redeploy the backend to a different URL, update that constant instead.

## "Interviewing" renamed to "Interview"

The manual tracker's status option/filter/badge that used to say
"Interviewing" is now "Interview" everywhere (Add form, status dropdown,
filter chip, stats). Status matching in the popup is now case-insensitive
too, so a job saved with any casing of a known status still filters and
displays correctly.
